i) When we use Huffman compression for songs, there are a bunch of things that can affect how well it works. First off, the length of the songs is important. If the songs are really long, there's more stuff to compress, so it can help make the file smaller. Then there are the frequencies of the letters and characters in the songs. If some letters or characters show up a lot, they can be given shorter codes, which makes the compression better. But if there are unique many characters, it can be harder to compress because each unique character needs its own node. For example, the Ratatouille mantra "anyone can cook" has limited compression potential due to its repetitive characters and short length. In contrast, the longer Rick Roll lyrics offer greater compression opportunities by taking advantage of repetition. The graph of the Huffman compressions displays this perfectly since the Rick Roll is reduced significantly and the Ratatoullie mantra is only reduced a little bit.

ii) The height of a Huffman tree shows how long the encoded message is on average. When we use Huffman compression for song lyrics, the frequency of certain letters or characters is important. If some letters or characters appear a lot, they get shorter codes, which makes the tree shorter and the compression better. It's good to have a balanced Huffman tree so that the codes are spread out evenly, but in song lyrics, it can be tricky because some letters or characters show up more than others. Huffman encoding helps with searching during decompression by creating a codebook that matches each symbol to its code. If the tree is well-structured and has shorter codes for the common symbols, searching for them is faster and the decompression goes smoother.
