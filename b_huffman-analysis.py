She did a great job, but I think I struggled during the midterm because there was only 50 minutes and I was unable to solve the problems fast enough. I\'m planning to enroll in the course again during the fall. Is there anything else I need to do to be eligible for grade forgiveness? Thank you for your time and consideration."
# You've Got a Friend in Me
